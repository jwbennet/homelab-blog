I purchased a few quality of life items for my homelab which arrived today so I spent my time refactoring a handful of connections to my homelab server.

## Goals

* Add new equipment to my homelab
* Re-add my Raspberry Pi nodes to my Kubernetes cluster

## Findings/Results

* Here is where I started the day in my homelab:

* Here is the cluster after adding a few quality of life items:

* Summary of upgrades:
    * I swapped the SATA to USB 3.0 connectors from [these from StarTech ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HJZJI84/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to [these from WAVLINK](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JSL3D6Q?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details). The StarTech adapters have worked well and I plan to repurpose them, but the length of the cable made the difficult to work around. I think the right angle connector on the new ones makes the cluster look considerably cleaner.
    * I added new HDMI keystone jacks next to each NUC along with a short HDMI jumper cable to hook it up. Until now I have needed to shut down all three NUCS and remove them if I needed to perform maintenance, but with these I now can access enough of the IO ports to be able to work with them as needed.
    * In the top left I added extra HDMI and USB 3.0 keystone jacks. I had spares from ordering them for other purposes, so I put them in my rack. I then used some spare cables I had lying around to connect those into my office workstation which is about 25 feet away. If I add a short USB and HDMI cable to connect these up it lets me work with the cluster from my normal workstation which has been very helpful. For example, I reformatted all of my Raspberry Pis this evening, and to do so I used one of the StarTech SATA adapters plugged into this USB port and then connected that to my office machine to format the Pis. I no longer need to pull those out either!
    * In the top right I added a couple of new CAT-6 keystone jacks and routed some new cable which allowed me to remove an unmanaged switch from my office. Those devices now come straight into my main switch.
    * Not pictured, but I am also trying out [these magnetic USB C adapters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XDK67YR?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) to make it easier to detach my work laptop when I need it to be mobile.
