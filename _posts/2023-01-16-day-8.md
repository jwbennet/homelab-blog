## Goals

* Learn more about [unbound](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/) and how I might [use it with Pi-hole](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/)

## Findings/Results

* As mentioned back on day 3 I am interested in using unbound to handle DNS within my homelab and home network. Today I spent some time with a couple of Docker images and a Helm chart available in the space and found a few things lacking:
    * The [Helm chart from pascaliske](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/pascaliske/unbound) worked out of the box but lacks some customization. Specifically, I'd like to be able to customize the configuration file through the use of a `ConfigMap`, but the configuration file for this is baked into his Docker image.
    * The unbound configuration baked into pascaliske's image lacks support for [DNSSEC](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/dnssec-what-is-it-why-important-2019-03-05-en) because it does not run `unbound-anchor` to download the trust anchor and the configuration doesn't reference the trust anchor. I found [this documentation](https://nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/howto-anchor/) on how to configure unbound to enable this feature.
    * I started customizing this into my own Docker image based on pascaliske's, but I need to decide if I want to use it or pivot to this more complete and more [widely used image from crazymax](https://github.com/crazy-max/docker-unbound). I think I may create my own Helm chart based on this image which allows me to customize the pieces I need instead of rolling my own image. This is a work in progress which will eventually be available through [jwbennet/homelab-pihole](https://github.com/jwbennet/homelab-pihole).
