## Goals

* Complete refactor of dev-bootstrap to be sourced from a JSON configuration file
* Complete setup of new laptop using dev-bootstrap

## Findings/Results

* Today I completed the setup of my new laptop using my [dev-boostrap project](https://github.com/jwbennet/dev-bootstrap). To do this I wanted to customize the process so it would not install every development tool on that machine because I am mostly using it as an RDP client. I started refactoring the process in [day 4]({% post_url 2023-01-04-day-4 %}) to use a JSON configuration file. That process is now complete. I store [my configuration file](https://github.com/jwbennet/dotfiles/blob/main/dot_dev-machine.json.tmpl) in [my dotfiles repository](https://github.com/jwbennet/dotfiles). It is templated with chezmoi so I can make decisions about when I want to include certain features/programs/configurations. So far this has worked well on my second machine.
