This is a fairly light day. It is my first day back at work after being out of the office for a couple of weeks so my energy level is fairly low.

## Goals

* Begin researching/tinkering with Pi-hole

## Findings/Results

* I have used [Pi-hole](https://docs.pi-hole.net/) in the past and it worked pretty well, but the SD card on the Pi I was running it on died and I never set it back up. It suffered from only having a single instance so if I did any maintenance I'd need to update the network configuration to use an alternate DNS provider to avoid outages. I also used [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) to do DNS-over-HTTP using Cloudflare as my DNS provider. This time I'd like to do a few different things to make this more robust:
    * Deploy Pi-hole on Kubernetes to allow me to have multiple instances
        * [This Helm chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/mojo2600/pihole) looks like a good starting point.
    * Setup a Kubernetes cron job to use [gravity-sync](https://github.com/vmstan/gravity-sync) to keep the replicas in sync with the primary Pi-hole node.
    * Use my newly configured Rook-managed Ceph cluster for storage.
    * Use the virtual IP address I setup for the k3s Kubernetes API to ensure that I have a resilient way to access Pi-hole. I think I can get by with a single VIP for both Kubernetes and Pi-hole since the routing will not work if I lose Kubernetes.
    * I would like to explore deploying `unbound` instead of `cloudflared` this time around. Both handle upstream DNS resolution, but `unbound` would run on my cluster so I can be sure the DNS logs are not available outside of my network unless I decide for them to be.
        * [Article from Pi-hole on this subject](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/)
        * There are not very active [pre-existing Helm charts](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?ts_query_web=unbound&sort=relevance&page=1) for deploying `unbound`, but I think [this one from pascaliske](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/pascaliske/unbound) looks like a good starting point.
        * :warning: When I get this working it might be worth contributing on [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/MoJo2600/pihole-kubernetes/issues/204). It mentions wanting to document how to configure both tools to work together so it would be a good place to share what I learn.
