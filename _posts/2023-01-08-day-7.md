## Goals

* Add support for `ReadWriteMany` persistent volumes

## Findings/Results

* I am contemplating setting up a server for hosting a game I've played a lot so I did some research and found the [KubicArk project](https://github.com/Cervator/KubicArk). This requires a shared filesystem for hosting cluster assets so I need to allow for the creation of `ReadWriteMany` persistent volumes. This will allow me to set up as many game servers for different maps but they can share the core cluster filesystem to allow them to be connected together.
* To setup these filesystems I read about the [Ceph Filesystem](https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.10/Storage-Configuration/Shared-Filesystem-CephFS/filesystem-storage) through Rook. I already had a Ceph cluster setup with Rook running in my homelab so this was an easy extension. For now I simply copied the definition of the file system custom resource, and added a storage class and everything seems to be setup for future use.
